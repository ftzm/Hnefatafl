--pause before ai move

-- mechanism for randomly choosing an ai strategy
-- pass in difficulty to ai

--implement loss when black has no more pieces

--find better way to handle if there is no board or ratio change on piece move than
--resetting the same board and ratio on gamestate

--AI ideas

--general
favour moves which yield the highest number of fruitful followup moves

--offence--


--defense--
all else equal, protect corners
