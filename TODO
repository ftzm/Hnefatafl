  AI


------general
--function to assess changed risk to pieces affected by the last move
--function to assess changed risk to pieces surrounding captures piece(s)

--lookahead one move on moves with large consequences, such as capturing a piece or putting a piece at risk. can substract positives of the next move from the positives of the original move.

--move selection
--instead of taking the first move with highest score, get all moves which share the highest score and choose a random one. So the game isn't so repetitive.

--pass in difficulty to ai

hardest difficulty will only select from moves tied for best score. next hardest will select from moves with the two highest rankings, etc.

--sometimes choose a shortsighted move (an attempt at capture that could result the AI's piece being capture next turn) randomly a certain what percentage of the time. The frequency of short-sighted moves could be a facet on which difficulty is adjusted

------white


------black
--have an aggressive ai that is willing to lose a piece to take a piece.
