  AI ideas
------------------------------------------------------------

------general
-- favour moves which yield the highest number of fruitful followup moves
-- pass in difficulty to ai
-- analyze courses of action based on multiple criteria, among them whether or not a piece is taken or lost, the queen's progress toward the corner, the number of good followup moves that a move enables, etc. it will become necessary to assign (somewhat arbitary) numerical values to each of these characteristics so that multiple moves can be compared against each-other.
--sometimes choose a shortsighted move (an attempt at capture that could result the AI's piece being capture next turn) randomly a certain percentage of the time. The frequency of short-sighted moves could be a facet on which difficulty is adjusted.

-- look further ahead for queen moves

------white


------black
--all else equal, protect corners
--inhibit queen movement if possible
--check the selection candidates for potentially game-losing queen movement further in the future.
--have an aggressive ai that is willing to lose a piece to take a piece.
