------general

--king threat = number of enemy pieces next to the king

--king escape = find route(s) with the shortest number of moves to escape. more points for more routes.

--
-- favour moves which yield the highest number of fruitful followup moves
-- pass in difficulty to ai
--sometimes choose a shortsighted move (an attempt at capture that could result the AI's piece being capture next turn) randomly a certain percentage of the time. The frequency of short-sighted moves could be a facet on which difficulty is adjusted

--inhibit queen movement if possible
--check the selection candidates for potentially game-losing queen movement further in the future.
--have an aggressive ai that is willing to lose a piece to take a piece.
