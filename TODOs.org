* Engine
** TODO loss after repeated moves
** TODO implement history (potentially limited by the number of moves within which repetition is forbidden)
** TODO surround capture
** TODO game end when king occupies corner adacent sqaure. Saves time and cpu.
** TODO improve code organization, potentially make even smaller files.
** TODO separate board storage method such that one can easily swap out backends.
   direct access to neighboard may turn out to be more important than fast lookup as i implement
   remaining engine functions and more ai functions
** reorganize turn functions?
** route functions needed for console runner, etc, through engine?
** consider lenses for field access
** consider lenses for field access in state monad during turns
** reconsider the postturn format
*** it is good to have either wrap it to cut short evaluation, 
** maybe back to x,y
** maybe moves to a 4 tuple with only the last coord in each dir
* AI
** General
*** TODO write a basic implementation of MCTS
*** TODO better implementation of ai: combination of monte cristo tree search with board judgements I'm making
*** Board evaluation
**** TODO functions to assess changed risk to pieces affected by the last move
***** was the piece in danger where it was
      tweak this to make sure that when the king is blocked from the corner by a corner adjacent defender
      and then moves out by just one square, the corner adjacent defender moves out as well to block instead
      of bringing in a new piece, because otherwise the king will just move back and kill the original defender.
      in practical terms this will mean scoring moving a (corner adjacent) carefully against king stoppage.
      On second thought, this might be more easily solved by simply looking ahead one move, either usign MCTS or
      a more basic manual lookahead of the best moves.
***** is the piece in danger where it is now
      already have a function for this, make sure it is in step so that there isn't a net positive for moving from
      risk to risk for example
***** does the absence of this piece in its previous position put its surrounding pieces at increased risk
      basically check if the closest piece in one direction can threaten any pieces if it were to move to any
      square on the other side or the vacated square.
****** only need to analyze perpendicularly
***** does moving to the new position prevent other things from being threatened
****** only need to analyze perpendicularly
***** does it threaten new pieces?
****** only need to analyze perpendicularly
**** TODO function to assess changed risk to pieces surrounding captured piece(s)
**** don't award points for threatening a piece i want to exist
**** awareness of which pieces are most important for blocking king, for example by finding route to corner which is shortest and has fewest pieces in it
*** move selection
**** instead of taking the first move with highest score, get all moves which share the highest score and choose a random one. So the game isn't so repetitive.
*** pass in difficulty to ai
*** hardest difficulty will only select from moves tied for best score. next hardest will select from moves with the two highest rankings, etc.
*** sometimes choose a shortsighted move (an attempt at capture that could result the AI's piece being capture next turn) randomly a certain what percentage of the time. The frequency of short-sighted moves could be a facet on which difficulty is adjusted
*** mechanism for randomly choosing an ai strategy
*** lookahead one move on moves with large consequences, such as capturing a piece or putting a piece at risk. can substract positives of the next move from the positives of the original move.
** White
** Black
*** TODO discourage protecting adjacent to corners
*** prioritize corners just behind king stoppage, perhaps at roughly same level as taking
*** when cutting off king moves prioritize moving next to a friendly piece
*** no points for threatening pieces that are blocking king escape
*** have an aggressive ai that is willing to lose a piece to take a piece.
